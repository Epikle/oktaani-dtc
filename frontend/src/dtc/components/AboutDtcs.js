      <strong>ISO/SAE controlled codes (core DTCs)</strong>
      <br />
      ISO/SAE-controlled diagnostic trouble codes are those codes where industry
      uniformity has been achieved. These codes were felt to be common enough
      across most manufacturersâ€™ applications that a common number and fault
      message could be assigned.
